About Scrum framework/15.08.2021
Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.
**Updated 17.08.2021**
Scrum starts with a product backlog, which is a list of all the needs of the product owner. This list is prioritized, depending on what gives the customer the most value. Then a sprint planning is carried out, where a small portion of this entire list is taken and it is decided how that piece is going to be implemented.
